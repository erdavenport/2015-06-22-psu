<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
  <a href="https://www.imaging.psu.edu/">SLEIC</a> is running a
  free two-day <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a> bootcamp
  at Penn State, University Park. Software Carpentry's mission
  is to help scientists and engineers get more research done in less
  time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
  scientific computing.  This hands-on workshop will cover basic
  concepts and tools, including program design, version control, data
  management, and task automation, using Unix, Matlab, and Git.
  Participants will be encouraged to
  help one another and to apply what they have learned to their own
  research problems.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.

  SETUP

  This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
-->

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
  To participate in a Software Carpentry workshop, you will need
  access to the software described below. In addition, you will
  need an up-to-date web browser.
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.
  If you are using a University computer and have any trouble getting
  Bash, Git, a code/text editor, and Exceed On Demand installed via the
  IT department, please get in touch so we can
  help. Bradley Taber-Thomas also has weekly programming office hours
  on Wednesdays, 2:30-4pm, in 267 Moore; feel free to stop by
  if you need assistance setting up.
</p>

<div id="shell"> <!-- Start of 'shell' section. -->
  <h3>#The Bash Shell</h3>

  <p>
    Bash is a commonly-used shell that gives you the power to do simple
    tasks more quickly.
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>
        Install Git for Windows by downloading and running
        <a href="http://msysgit.github.io/">the installer</a>.
        This will provide you with both Git and Bash in the Git Bash program.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell in all versions of Mac OS X is bash, so no
        need to install anything.  You access bash from the Terminal
        (found in
        <code>/Applications/Utilities</code>).  You may want to keep
        Terminal in your dock for this workshop.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="shell-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        The default shell is usually Bash, but if your
        machine is set up differently you can run it by opening a
        terminal and typing <code>bash</code>.  There is no need to
        install anything.
      </p>

<div id='git'> <!-- Start of 'Git' section. GitHub browser compatability
           is given at https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/-->
  <h3>#Git</h3>

  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
  </p>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>
        Git should be installed on your computer as part of your Bash
        install (described above).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-macosx">Mac OS X</h4>
      <p>
        <strong>For OS X 10.9 and higher</strong>, install Git for Mac
        by downloading and running the most recent "mavericks" installer from
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">this list</a>.
        After installing Git, there will not be anything in your <code>/Applications</code> folder,
        as Git is a command line program.
        <strong>For older versions of OS X (10.5-10.8)</strong> use the
        most recent available installer labelled "snow-leopard"
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/">available here</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <h4 id="git-linux">Linux</h4>
      <p>
        If Git is not already available on your machine you can try to
        install it via your distro's package manager. For Debian/Ubuntu run
        <code>sudo apt-get install git</code> and for Fedora run
        <code>sudo yum install git</code>.

  <h3>#Text Editor</h3>

  <p>
    When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
    optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
    color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
    Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
    intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
    typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
    exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.

  <div class="row">

      <h4 id="editor-windows">Windows</h4>
      <p>
        nano is a basic editor and the default that instructors use in the workshop.
        To install it, 
        download the <a href="{{site.swc_installer}}">Software Carpentry Windows installer</a>
        and double click on the file to run it.
        <strong>This installer requires an active internet connection.</strong>

  <h3>#Matlab via Hammer</h3>

  <p>
    Matlab is commercial software and an expensive liscense
    is needed to install it.
    Thus, we will be using Matlab via a virtual machine connected to
    Hammer, one of the University's computing clusters.
    This is a simple way to access Matlab, and will give you some
    familiarity with using the high performance computing clusters on campus.
    If you do not already have a Hammer account, or Exceed onDemand installed,
    follow these instructions to set them up:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Request an account through the Institute for CyberScience--
      click "Individual User Account" on the left menu at the
      <a href="http://rcc.its.psu.edu/resources/accounts/">ICS System Accounts page</a>,
      log in, and provide the requested information.
      Be sure to check the "Hammer" box under "ICS Linux Clusters."
      In the computational and data requirements box enter
      "minimal; learning to use ICS clusters."
      Other questions can be answered individually.
    </li>
    <li>
      Follow the <a href="http://rcc.its.psu.edu/user_guides/remote_display/exceed_on_demand/">ICS instructions</a>
      to install Exceed onDemand for your operating system.
      The instructions also describe how to log in to Hammer in Exceed onDemand;
      please make sure you can login <em>before</em> the workshop,
      as it will be difficult to address login issues during the workshop.
    </li>
    <li>
      We will go over opening Matlab on Hammer during the workshop.
    </li>
  </ol>
